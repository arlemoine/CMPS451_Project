# C2

Using a Python library,

1. Generate two data sets from a Normal distribution (Mean=10, Var=4) and from a uniform distribution of range [4, 16]; then, draw the q-q plot. Show quantile markers at 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%. Quantitatively analyze this data set based on this qq-plot.

2. Draw the given data set on a parallel-coordinates plot. Quantitatively analyze this data set based on this parallel-coordinates plot.

| AGE | WEIGHT | HEIGHT |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 50 | 160 | 5 |
| 25 | 130 | 6 |
| 30 | 200 | 4 |
| 65 | 150 | 4.5 |
| 55 | 170 | 5.2 |
| 75 | 165 | 4.8 |
| 45 | 180 | 5.8 |
| 70 | 190 | 4.8 |
| 40 | 200 | 5.8 |
